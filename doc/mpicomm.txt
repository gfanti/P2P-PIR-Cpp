Documentation for MPIStreamBuf class

The MPIStreamBuf is used for communication over MPI with iostreams.

*** NOTE: This class is not functioning properly.


A) STREAM BUFFER

The MPIStreamBuf is a stream buffer used in MPI communications.  The
constructor requires the rank of the other party with whom the communication is
with (and optionally the COMM that the communication happens in).

A pointer to the MPIStreamBuf object is then passed into std::iostream() to
create a stream for communicating with the other rank using iostreams.
