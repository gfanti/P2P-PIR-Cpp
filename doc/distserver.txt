Documentation for PercyDistServer class.

These classes are used to distribute the server operations of Percy++ over a
number of servers.


A) PARAMS CLASS

The PercyDistServerParams class contains some special parameters:

    vsplit      The number of sets that the rows of the database is evenly
		split into
    hsplit	The number of sets that the columns of the database is evenly
		split into
    workerio    Contains the iostreams used to communicate with the workers.

    ** All other parameters are inherited from PercyServerParams.

Worker iostreams in workerio are managed using the functions:

    set_workerio()	    Sets the worker iostream for a given worker
    unset_workerio()	    Unsets the worker iostream for a given worker
    have_all_workerio()	    Returns true if all vsplit*hsplit worker iostreams
			    have been set.
    get_workerio()	    Returns the vector of worker iostreams.


B) SERVER CLASS

The PercyMasterServer class receives requests from a client using
handle_request, send the partial queries to the workers, combines the results
and sends them back to the client.

The handle_requests function is called just as in the base class PercyServer.
