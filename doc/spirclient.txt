A) METHODS

bool init_parameters (const PercyClientParams &params, 
	nservers_t num_servers, nservers_t t, const dbsize_t block_number,
	const vec_ZZ_p &indices, const vec_vec_ZZ_p &shares, 
	const vec_ZZ_pX &polyvec);

    Initializes all of the parameters that need to be sent to the server.

bool send_to_server (const PercyClientParams &params, 
	nservers_t server_index, std::ostream &os);
